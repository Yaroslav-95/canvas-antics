# Let It Snow #

It is presicely what you imagine.

To start the animation, just call this function, and (optionally) pass some options to it to configure the animation to your liking. For it to work you should have a canvas object in your document with id #snow.

```javascript
letItSnow({
    'max_particles': 200,
    'base_speed': 200,
    'max_xspeed': 300,
    'max_tradius': 20,
    'max_tduration': 5000,
    'interactive': true,
});
```

Happy holidays 2018 and happy 2019!
